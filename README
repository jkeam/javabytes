JavaBytes
=====================================

Welcome to Javabytes, a disassembler for your java code. Inspired by a project by Matt Godbold called [GCC Explorer](https://github.com/mattgodbolt/gcc-explorer).
Enter some arbitrary java code and this application will do a few things: 

1. Generate some random class to hold your code.
2. Put all of the code you entered into a public static void test() method.

This will make more sense once you see the disassembled code.

An example can be found [here](http://javabytes.herokuapp.com/).
